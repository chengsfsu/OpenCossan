# OpenCossan

OpenCossan is a Matlab-based toolbox for uncertainty quantification and management. The implemented framework includes third-party software integration (e.g. ANSYS), efficient numeric algorithms (e.g. Line Sampling) and parallelization for high performance computing. OpenCossan functionalities can be summarized in:

 - Uncertainty Quantification
 - Simulation-based Reliability Analysis
 - Sensitivity Analysis
 - Meta-Modelling
 - Stochastic Finite Elements Analysis
 - Reliability-Based Optimization
